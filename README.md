# swipe-arc-tracker
A rough JS tool to test lockscreen targeting and illustrate finger paths onscreen. Made for Nexus5X Firefox/Chrome. Created to improve the 'sweetspot' target and to show why current one needs improvement. Current targetarea does not account for normal hand position when holding phone. Grrr...
## Who's This For?
Other new learners who want to tinker with a simple, browser-based tool to track onscreen paths and futz with the minutiae of interactions. Contributions from other beginners especially welcome!
## Status
Currently tracks touch paths, archives paths, and registers successful hits.
## Files Herein
- Main JS file, finger.js
- A helper JS file, improved-array-class.js (Imported from julianjensen/vector)
- HTML and CSS, index.html
## Next Steps
Deactivating canvas and archiving path on success. Exporting path data, diagrams current vs improved targetareas, URL.
